# Notes and Code from POODR

This a repo to collect the notes and code from reading Practice Object-Oriented Design in Ruby by Sandi Metz.

## Why POODR?
I'm reading POODR because I want to be a good software engineer. I've watched several of Sandi Metz's talks from various Ruby conferences and she presents principles and techniques to help engineers write software that is designed to be easy to maintain and easy to change. She calls these techniques and principles Object-Oriented Design (OOD).

I'll be writing about what I learn about OOD after I'm done with each chapter starting from chapter 2, Designing Classes with a Single Responsibility. I'll have notes from each chapter in the [notes](notes) folder and here I'll be writing a summary of what I learned in each chapter trying to write as if I had to explain it to someone else as a test of my understanding.
